## pack (builder)

Create a Docker image using CloudNative Buildpacks.

**Pack requires access to a Docker daemon.** For remote builds, such as those
triggered by [Git polling](/docs/projects/git), the
[runner](/docs/runner) needs to have access to a Docker daemon such
as exposing the Docker socket, enabling Docker-in-Docker, etc. Unfortunately,
pack doesn't support dockerless builds. Configuring Docker access within
a Docker container is outside the scope of these docs, please search the
internet for "Docker in Docker" or other terms for more information.

### Interface

- Input: **component.Source**
- Output: **pack.Image**

### Examples

```hcl
build {
  use "pack" {
	builder     = "heroku/buildpacks:18"
	disable_entrypoint = false
  }
}
```

### Mappers

#### Allow pack images to be used as normal docker images

- Input: **pack.Image**
- Output: **docker.Image**

### Required Parameters

This plugin has no required parameters.

### Optional Parameters

These parameters are used in the [`use` stanza](/docs/waypoint-hcl/use) for this plugin.

#### builder

The buildpack builder image to use.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**
- Default: heroku/buildpacks:18

#### buildpacks

The exact buildpacks to use.

If set, the builder will run these buildpacks in the specified order. They can be listed using several [URI formats](https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-developer-guide/specific-buildpacks).

- Type: **list of string**
- **Optional**

#### disable_entrypoint

If set, the entrypoint binary won't be injected into the image.

The entrypoint binary is what provides extended functionality such as logs and exec. If it is not injected at build time the expectation is that the image already contains it.

- Type: **bool**
- **Optional**

#### static_environment

Environment variables to expose to the buildpack.

These environment variables should not be run of the mill configuration variables, use waypoint config for that. These variables are used to control over all container modes, such as configuring it to start a web app vs a background worker.

- Type: **map of string to string**
- **Optional**

### Output Attributes

Output attributes can be used in your `waypoint.hcl` as [variables](/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables) via [`artifact`](/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/artifact) or [`deploy`](/docs/waypoint-hcl/variables/deploy).

#### build_labels

- Type: **map of string to string**

#### image

- Type: **string**

#### tag
