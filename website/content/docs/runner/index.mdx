# Waypoint Remote Runners

Waypoint utilizes "runners" to execute Waypoint operations remotely. Runners
are responsible for performing builds and deploys, polling projects
for changes, and more.

Waypoint automatically installs a single runner by default when the Waypoint
server is installed with [`waypoint install`](/commands/install). This lets
you get up and running with runners out of the box quickly. Additional runners
must be ran manually.

-> **Runners are optional.** Waypoint can function without runners but
certain functionality becomes unavailable. See [Disabling Runners](#disabling-runners)
for more information.

## Disabling Runners

Runners can be disabled if desired. With runners disabled, Waypoint executes
all operations via the local CLI (even when communicating with a remote
[server](/docs/server)).

### Unavailable Functionality

With runners disabled, certain functionality becomes unavailable:

- Remote operations
- Git polling

In addition to disabled functionality, consider that all clients must now
have proper credentials for the target platforms (such as AWS, GCP, etc.)
since without runners they must execute all operations locally.

### Disabling Runner Installation

Prior to installation, runners can be disabled by specifying the
`-runner=false` flag to the [`waypoint install`](/commands/install) command.
This will not install a runner.

To uninstall a runner that is already installed, the only option today is
to uninstall and reinstall Waypoint with a
[data snapshot and restore](/docs/server/run/maintenance#backup-restore). You
may also manually go into your platform and delete the runner, but Waypoint
can't automate this for you today.
